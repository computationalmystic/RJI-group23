This program provides a user interface for users to upload and assess the quality of photos. The stakeholder is the Renoylds Journalism Institute, which has an abundance of images and needs a way to sort through and narrow down those options. Idealo image quality assessment program is used to give photos scores based on their technical and aesthetic qualities. Users, primarily photographers and journalists, are able to login, upload photos, and view other photos and their scores.
