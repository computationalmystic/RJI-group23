1. We are using Idealo Image Quality Assessment. It is based off of Google’s Nima Architecture so it can provide two ratings. One based on technical and one based on aesthetic.
2. So far, we have only used the example classifiers. This is a temporary practice as it does not provide accurate predictions for pictures that are very different than the example images given. It has no advantage other than it being less work. Once we begin to build a classifier based on Ed McCain’s photos, our classifier will become a lot more accurate, but only for the type he has provided. A feature that could make this easier is a quick train option where the photographer can click through a few photos and rate them once they upload them. The assessment would then use the photographer’s choices to assess the images.
